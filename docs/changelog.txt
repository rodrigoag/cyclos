Cyclos 3 changelog
==================

Version 3.7.3
-------------

New / modified functions
 * Changed the hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size to 1 by default (previously, was 20). Now, Cyclos takes up much less memory, at minimum cost of performance.

Bug fixes
 * An unexpected exception could cause the Lucene indexing thread to be interrupted, resulting in no more indexes being updated
 * There was a possible error while indexing members
 * There could be errors when exporting data (member, member records, ads) with custom fields of type member autocomplete
 * On PosWeb receive payment, when selecting the empty option for payment type, an error was being displayed
 * A bug introduced in 3.7.2 prevented members from editing their own profile if there were custom fields marked as unique
 * Custom fields with mask and flagged as unique were not correctly checked for uniqueness, making the validation always pass
 * Payment custom fields which are marked as unique Ignore unique validation on payment custom field when transaction was cancelled or denied
 * Custom fields of type URL were not being correctly validated
 * Caches were not being correctly invalidated when deactivating an advertisement category, leading to inactive categories being shown on the advertisement search

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.7.2
-------------

New / modified functions
 * New custom field type: member
 * Added a new option in member custom field on both Member search and Advertisements search: web services. So, the field can be used on web services searches without showing up on the application.
 * Improved some database connection pool configurations in cyclos.properties
 * Now the application root url (used on generated links) is no longer configured on the cyclos.properties file, but on the application itself (in local settings), and can be customized by group or group filter
 * Added a broker filter for administrators searching member records

Bug fixes
 * It was not possible to repay a loan from another account using the same currency as the loan destination account
 * Transfer types with permission are not returned when trying to perform a payment as user without permission to view system accounts
 * Rest webservice payment with percentage fees shows wrong amount at payment confirmation
 * Application error on member payment at amount validation when no payment type is provided
 * Possible application error on mobile login
 * Searching via web services using enumerated custom fields with multiple values was broken
 * The search indexes for member records could have stale data when updating the owner member (be aware that it takes a few seconds to update the indexes)
 * Transfer types on group permissions are not correct when changing visible accounts / groups and there are TTs marked as priority
 * If a member registration take a long time to be completed another new member could be registered with the same values avoiding the uniqueness restriction of some values (username, email, custom field marked as unique)
 * When removing an account from a group, if a member had it's limit for that account changed, the task which would deactivate the accounts failed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.7.1
-------------

New / modified functions
 * New url: [root]/do/redirect?name=loginPageName&path=redirectPath which will set the login page cookie for customizations and then redirect to the given path
 * Added min amount limit to transfer type
 * When confirming a payment, if there are fees which deduct from total amount, a total amount field is now displayed
 * On the make payment page, now the payment type name is always shown, even if there is only a single possible option
 * On the make payment page, the possible currencies (when multiple) are only shown after selecting the destination member, to avoid showing currencies there would be no possible payment types
 * Added an option on the payment type to control to which kind of users parent / child transactions will be visible
 * Increased the maximum length of both payment type and transaction fees to 100 characters
 * Added a group setting to not show the currency on payments, but all payment types directly
 * The result list on external account history was changed to be more like the regular account history, including adding a member column
 * The 'pending' status filter on external account history has been split in pending and complete and incomplete
 * When importing external payments, the line number is retained, and no longer will appear file import errors, but the transactions will be imported anyway, and import comments will be generated for each error
 * Added support for the first authorization level of system to member payments to be authorized by the receiver
 * For loans with interests, it is no longer possible to pay intermediate amounts, as fees were never calculated over partial amounts

Bug fixes
 * The chargeback permissions were not being correctly controlled by the receiving account
 * Error when searching for advertisements in web services using member custom fields as filters
 * When accessing the login page as guest while using url parameter for group-customized layout, there could happen errors on the log
 * Deadlock when using HazelcastLockHandler when performing an scheduled payment with the first expiration date for today
 * After importing an external payment with an empty payment type, if there was a single possible payment type, it was not possible to save the record
 * The login page fields were too large
 * When the current e-mail was empty and e-mail change validation was being used, there was an error while trying to set an e-mail for a member
 * Member custom fields with update / visibility access to 'Members not at registration' which were marked as required always led public registrations to fail validation
 * Under high concurrency, even when account locking was enabled, it was possible to exceed the maximum amount per day (set on the payment type)
 * Removed members were being returned on the autocomplete fields if admins could manage such groups
 * When the payment type has a maximum amount per day, a scheduled payment total amount was being checked at the current date, not each installment on the respective due date
 * When advertisement description contents had HTML comments, a broken layout could be produced on the advertisement list, if the text truncation would en in the middle of the comments
 * For new databases, the rest (mobile phone application) channel was not set as default to members

-----------

New / modified functions

Version 3.7_RC1
---------------

New / modified functions
 * Now e-mail validation can be configured in a more fine-grained way under member groups
 * Now e-mail validation is used not only to register new members, but also when changing the e-mail

 * Better memory management, releasing some acquired resources on shutdown, which helps preventing memory leaks
 * Removed the optimize indexes functionality, as it is no longer recommended by Lucene, the full-text engine used by Cyclos
 * Member custom fields where not being returned when loading an advertisement by id in web services
 * Improved internals of how messages are sent to groups
 * System images are no longer limited to the maximum image dimensions (in local settings)
 * New member permission to change external access
 * Added support (cyclos properties parameter) to create sms data when populate the db from scratch

 * Deadlock when making payments with lock in all (from and to) accounts
 * There was an error when attempting to accept an invoice with multiple possible payment types
 * There was an error if the cyclos.lockHandler.timeoutSeconds property had an space right after the number

 * An administrator with the permission to view account management, but without permission to view account information for any system accounts always had an error when trying to view the system accounts overview page
 * If a scheduled account fee was disabled for a long time and then re-enabled, the next charged period would be wrong, taking the old execution as base

Version 3.6
-----------

New / modified functions
 * Improved HTML / JavaScript performance and standards compliance
 * On the login form, pressing enter will focus the next field, or submit the form if on password field

Bug fixes
 * Members couldn't see their operators. After the first member listed his operators / groups, other members wouldn't be able to see their own operators
 * When an installment of a scheduled payment when authorization is needed is authorized, it means now that on due dates, the next installments won't go through the authorization process again
 * When exporting members or advertisements as CSV, the last record was not being included on the file
 * Scheduled payments from system to member would result in a permission error if the receiver member would try to view the payment details
 * It was not possible to save transaction fees
 * When using a customized login page for group / group filter, clicking on access options would show the global login page
 * Now the error page during posweb has the posweb header and footer (if customized, as they are empty by default)
 * There were no confirmation messages for info texts being inserted or modified
 * Operators without permissions to view his member's account couldn't do receive payments on WebPOS. Also, without the regular make payment permission, the WebPOS make payment permission was not enough
 * When an account fee was disabled, then re-enabled in a future date, the next execution was being based on the last execution, not on the new enabling date
 * Administrator notifications from payments made through external channels were not being sent
 * When editing an existing customized file, after clicking change and then cancel, the contents were cleared

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.6_RC2
---------------

New / modified functions
 * General auditing and review on security. Cyclos should be much more secure now
 * Faster startup times
 * Lots of performance improvements
 * It is now possible to deploy Cyclos in a cluster, allowing not only high availability, but better scalability
 * It is now possible to choose whether to log to trace file only if there were database writes
 * Now logging generated from web service access goes to a separate file
 * Added an access setting to allow or not concurrent logins from the same user
 * Support was added to allow a WS client to set a trace data that will be transferred to the external WS implementors. For example: trace data attached to a payment done by WS will be transferred to the receiver through the corresponding notification generated from that payment
 * Added the possibility to use a local receipt printer on PosWeb and in the main web interface for printing transaction receipts (a permission should be granted first)
 * Processed payment requests can now be printed directly on the request payment page
 * Now operators can filter the account history by operator, just like the member
 * Payments generated through accepted invoices which were sent by operators can now be queried on the account history through the operator filter
 * Added a blacklist and a whitelist for groups allowed to login in cyclos.properties
 * Added 2 extra options for transaction fees as payer or receiver: source member broker and destination member broker
 * Added to member group the default options for SMS notifications (allow charging, accept free mailings and accept paid mailings)
 * When no card types or registration agreements, those no longer appear on group details page
 * It is now possible to have ad interests only with title and type
 * When there are pending commission contracts, the member home shows a link now
 * The admin e-mail notification for new registered members has been extended not only to public registration, but now allows any member group and any type of registration
 * On broker's registered members list the status filter for 'Awaiting activation' now only shows up if the broker's group has inactive groups as possible initial groups for registration
 * Broker commissions paid by members now only allows the corresponding broker in relation to the member paying the commission (either source or destination). Previous versions allowed a quite strange combination of one member paying to the other one's broker, which conflicted with commission contracts and default commission settings
 * Now it's possible to have a catalog with the SMS operations. This will allow, for example, add custom commands to the SMS module and set the corresponding message showed in the SMS log
 * The state overview report now supports a date / time for historical data. However, this is not available for invoices, loans and references, as historical data is not stored
 * Added a class name for callbacks on processed transactions in both transfer type (for specific transactions) and in local settings (for all transactions)
 * Now there is a checkbox in the payment custom field to enable / disable it for new payments. It is not possible to remove custom fields once they are used
 * Association or deactivation of new accounts now runs in background.

Bug fixes
 * When inserting advertisement categories, the newly created category's order was not at the end of the list
 * When mixing scheduled payments which reserve the total amount with authorized payments, amount reservations were not being correctly returned
 * On posweb access, if the user had an expired password, he/she'd not be forced to change
 * On posweb access, if the member had a pending registration agreement, he/she'd not be forced to accept it
 * Limited system accounts with credit limit greater than zero were not honoring the limit
 * The form for new static document and edit member document didn't work on Google Chrome
 * Removing images didn't remove them from disk cache on the server
 * It was not being validated that a payment cannot be performed if there are pending commission contracts
 * On database creation groups with associated accounts were not set active
 * On the edit transfer type page, scheduled payment settings shouldn't be displayed for loans
 * Customized files which are no longer used will be automatically removed from database on next startup
 * On the account fees log file, when a fee is finished, the log was being generated as if it were starting

Version 3.6_RC1a
----------------

New / modified functions
 * Added to the web service client the possibility to ignore e-mail and custom field validations for member registrations

Bug fixes
 * On broker group permissions, transfer types for chargebacks and channels for request payment were not being saved
 * It was not possible to remove a member's broker. It is now possible on the change broker to leave the new broker empty
 * Broker commissions for newly created brokers were not being paid, until the first customization of default commission status
 * Fees with a very small percentage on small payments which generated amounts smaller than than 0.01 (depending on the precision) could generate payments of amount zero, which caused errors
 * A member was able to pay via Web services to another member he couldn't see the profile
 * Theme was not persisted when applied and an image referenced by it didn't previously exist

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.6_RC1
---------------

New / modified functions
 * Several database queries have been optimized, which yields noticeable performance improvements in large databases
 * Now, for new databases, a per-user hash is used, which is more secure

 * The payment request search page was improved showing useful data (ticket creation date, request/confirmation channel)
 * Now Broker/Admin can select a member as the target of a SMS mailing
 * Added an option in cyclos.properties to skip members and advertisements ordering, not to impact performance too much on large databases
 * Now the history for system accounts is initially filtered for payments starting at the first day of the previous month, so that on large databases, the impact will be low for system accounts, which tend to have many payments
 * Allows searching advertisements via web services by status
 * Allows searching members via web services by e-mail
 * Added the info texts, which are messages which can be retrieved through web services
 * Now, if there are missing translation keys, the English translations will be used

 * Notifications sent by e-mail to administrators were not sent on background, causing the process to hang until the e-mail was sent
 * If the PIN (Card Security Code) was blocked and the blocked time (after max wrong tries) was expired then the PIN (Card Security Code) never could be unblocked
 * The member transaction summary report was not returning all data when the member result display (in local settings) was set to username
 * On web services, loading an advertisement was not returning the custom fields
 * Searching members / ads using keywords (full text search) and filtering with enumerated custom fields always had no results
 * The search invoices was not using the setting to display members as name / username - username was always being used
 * The confirm webshop payment page was displaying a selection field for principal type when only a single option was allowed
 * Searching member record types using keywords by admins was never returning results

 * Canceling scheduled payment installments with a reserved amount didn't return the reserved amount to the account
 * The external login was only usable if the script tag including the cyclos_root/externalLogin.js was the first script tag on the document
 * The member transaction details was printing the inverse signal on transactions
 * When using zero as max print results, print pages were returning no results, instead of unlimited (which is the semantic of max = zero)
 * Custom fields which used text areas were not allowing input if the max length was not defined
 * The account status for scheduled payments was being correctly updated
 * Some payment notifications were not correct
 * Members were not being able to see the 'brokering events' notification type in the notification preferences page. This type is only shown to member with a broker

 * If the admin removes the permission for a group for a given transfer type, and a member had an scheduled payment of that type, he could still manually process an installment
 * When using a timezone, the scheduling hour was being considered as the local server's time, not as the Cyclos instance time
 * The semantics when setting an advertisement category to active / inactive were sometimes not correct
 * The transaction number was not being assigned for scheduled payments
 * If the public registration was in a group which has a customized login page, after confirming the registration, that customized login page was not being displayed
 * Invoices search was missing the result pagination
 * In the notification translation, changed the SMS one-line text field to a multi-line field
 * Admin records were not showing up
 * Right after inserting a new document, if the admin tried to view that document on a member's profile, there would be a permission denied error
 * The load by username on login was being performed 3 times
 * Make sure that all updates occur only on actually modified columns (avoids missing data concurrent updates for different columns)
 * Payments as member by admins for authorized payments, when the same admin performing the payment is also the authorizer could lead to incorrect account balance
 * Error when a member was changing his operator's password
 * Print account history was not showing charged back payments as strike-through

 * When saving / activating / deactivating an advertisement category, the counters would sometimes be incorrect
 * There was an error when an operators would attempt to accept an invoice
 * Linked (parent-child) custom fields for payments was not working
 * Previously, on the member transactions report summary, payment filters only with system to member payments would never show a debits column. The same for member to system and credits. This prevented chargebacks from showing up. So, now all columns are shown (depending solely on the checkboxes for debits / credits)
 * After including a login form from another website, if the user performed a 'regular' login in cyclos, after logging out, the user would still be redirected to the url passed by the external login form
 * The account history for removed member was not visible
 * It was possible to chargeback a transfer from / to a removed member
 * When moving an user to a removed group, if the user was logged in, his session would still be valid (until logging out / timeout). Now the user is immediately disconnected.
 * On Internet Explorer, the layout for search POS devices and SMS logs reports was broken
 * The 'performed by' (admin / broker / operator) field was not being copied from transfers to the generated fees
 * Printing the manual would lead to wrong formatting
 * On the ads search, after searching with groups or group filters on the search, it was not possible to uncheck them (unless clicking the menu item again)

-------------

Bug fixes

 * The webshop payments were considering the access setting for login password virtual keyboard on transaction passwords
 * Now the account status is updated in the background, which improves both performance and reliability
 * Fixed a problem handling dates when time zone is enabled in local settings
 * In the edit ad page, root categories which have no child categories are show before others. Before, they were blending with other parent categories

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Now a query string could be passed to the mobile login page to specify a group/group filter allowing to load his customized files
 * Now pending members emails must be unique, which helps preventing people from registering multiple times
 * The style classes .adTitle, .adDescription, .adOwner were replaced by .productTitle, .productDescription, .productOwner, as they were being removed by the AdBlock FireFox extension. Customized CSS files are automatically updated for the new classes
 * Now the print members page hides custom fields without value, making it take less space for printing
 * Now the export members to CSV includes the broker name also (previously it was only the broker login)
 * Implemented both search and export to csv function for pending members
 * Now in account history, payments and their generated transfers appear in the expected order. Previously, generated transfers were appearing before the original transfer
 * The webshop payment cancellation confirmation has been removed, as it was confusing to have ok/cancel for a cancellation
 * Now the print pages do not set the focus on the print button, which might cause a confusing scroll on some pages

Bug fixes
 * When inserting a new advertisement, the description format was always plain text, despite the settings
 * Under some circumstances, a theme should be applied twice to have effect

 * In the pending member profile, when clicking change then cancel, the resend e-mail button was being disabled too
 * Pending payments to authorize were not being shown to members as payer, only as receiver
 * When using a customized static file inside a customized login page for a specific group / group filter, and that static page was also customized for the group / group filter, the globally customized page was being shown
 * File customization for group / group filter didn't work in Internet Explorer
 * Operators that could see at least one of his member's accounts could actually see them all
 * Password policy for a member group was not being enforced on his operators

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.5.2
-------------

New / modified functions
 * Added 2 more settings in member group: max pin wrong tries and deactivation time after pin tries
 * Added another visibility type for member custom field in the editable by property: Member not at registration
 * Now in account fees, the free base parameter is also used for fixed amount fees. In such cases, the fee is charged only when the balance is greater than the free base
 * Now the account fee charge waits 10ms instead of 500ms after charging each member, making it faster while not so cpu intensive
 * It's now possible to specify the creation date for imported members, which should be done in the column named creationdate
 * The webshop payment page has been changed a bit to make it easier to fit in layout with the customized files (webshop_header.jps and webshop_footer.jsp)

Bug fixes
 * Setting the pin for a member which had none was not saving the new value
 * Modifying an existing registration agreement was showing a normal, not a rich text editor for the contents
 * The e-mail validation option in member groups was only being displayed when the group was set as initial group
 * Admins / brokers without permission to manage pending member, when registering members with e-mail validation enabled would see the pending member profile with the change / submit buttons. Trying to save would result in permission error anyway, but the buttons are now hidden
 * Disconnecting an user from the connected users list would disconnect all sessions for that user, not just the specified one
 * An admin or broker registering a member, when setting to manually assign password, password was not being validated as required
 * When performing a payment or sending an invoice, after selecting a member, when there are no possible payment types, there was a loop of the alert box saying there were no payment types
 * Transfer types from systems were being created without the web channel enabled, rendering them unusable
 * There was a bug in the URL validation, making it, for example, impossible to generate webshop tickets
 * Hidden member custom field values were being indexed, and possibly allowing searching over those values
 * Under some circumstances, importing advertisements was resulting in application exception
 * There was a wrong translation key in the current state reports
 * The upper credit limit, when used, was not being shown in the account history
 * Webshop payments were allowed even when the client member was not related to the channel
 * In webshop payments when fees are applied, they were not being shown

 * Currency patterns were not being applied in the personal member reports page
 * When a contact is being added and was already in the contact list, a new message is shown
 * In the popup which displays thumbnails / images, when the displayed image was too small, window was being resized smaller than it should, and the thumbnails were not visible
 * Using webshop payments with transaction password enabled was not validating the transaction password

New application translation keys
 * contact.error.alreadyExists
 * customField.member.access.MEMBER_NOT_REGISTRATION
 * group.settings.maxPinWrongTries
 * group.settings.pinBlockTimeAfterMaxTries
 * memberImport.status.INVALID_CREATION_DATE
 * webshop.error.paymentDisabled

Removed application translation keys

 * reports.stats.activity.singlePeriod.loginTimes.row1.short
 * webshop.title.confirm
 * webshop.title.confirmation
 * webshop.title.payment

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.5.1
-------------

New / modified functions
 * Added a property in the advertisement model retrieved via web services indicating whether the description is html or plain text
 * Now in posweb, when a payment is performed, instead of showing a button above the form, the payment data is displayed with a print link and a close button. Only after closing a new payment can be performed. The old behavior was confusing for some people.
 * In member notifications in, for example, payments and invoices from system, instead of seeing "from the administration (the administration)", now it is "from the administration (Cyclos)". Those variables are the system settings application name and application username

Bug fixes
 * When a text input format in local settings (such as ad description) and the default was plain text, another text area was being displayed
 * When transaction password is not used, the manage external password page has javascript errors
 * The container page was not being honored when validating a registration e-mail
 * Layout on login page was left-aligned
 * A last time commit broke both member and ad imports
 * The password policy was not used for pin to enforce simple pins or prevent previous pins to be reused
 * Having more than one custom field with rich text editor would make only a the first one to be displayed
 * After the e-mail validation, when the initial group is inactive, a message was shown as if the member could login immediately, not the one he should wait for administration to activate him
 * Under some circumstances, a member accepting a system invoice would result in application error
 * In firefox, if there was a password remembered, the transaction password, when requested, defaulted to that remembered password
 * Sending a message was always plain text, despite the settings

New application translation keys
 * changePin.error.tooSimple

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.5
-----------

New / modified functions
 * Enumerated custom fields which are required now have a "Please select..." label when the value is empty
 * Added a new local setting for decimal numbers input method: right to left (the classical mode, only numbers are typed) or left to right (should type the whole numbers, the decimal separator and then decimal numbers)
 * Now in the web service clients it's possible to set as client address an IP range in form A.B.C.D-E
 * Now an operator group cannot have individual payment type permissions, as this could bypass system-wide payment types configurations. It also made the operator group permissions page simpler, as the member doesn't need to know which transfer types he should grant to operators

 * The new pending member alert was removed, as it's now possible for admins to choose which groups they want to be notified when new members are created

Version 3.5_RC2
---------------
If you are migrating from previous versions, please, check http://project.cyclos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Migration_3.0_-_3.5

New / modified functions
 * It's now possible to assign custom fields to payments through payment types. This has replaced the loan custom fields, which are now custom fields in loan types
 * The payment types which are to a member account now supports setting a fixed destination member: only payments to that member may use that payment type. Also useful in conjunction with the 'priority' setting for the payment type, making payments to special members to be of a specific type
 * Improved default theme and new system logo
 * Added the support to run Cyclos inside an iframe in another site
 * Now it's possible to specify a customized class to validate a custom field value
 * Now the 'member result display' setting is honored in the account history results
 * The member autocomplete fields (normally a login name and full name) are improved
 * The setting for virtual keyboard can now be set independently for login and transaction passwords
 * Added the possibility to a transaction fee be charged from / paid to a fixed member, which is often needed in systems where partner organizations play an important role (for example, receiving fees)
 * Now the e-mail notifications are queued in a separate thread, which makes general actions that perform notifications more responsive
 * Added the doBulkPayment() to PaymentWebService
 * Now a just registered pending by administrator guarantee can be removed from the system
 * Now the generated loan is showed in the guarantee details
 * On the initial database, now the loan repayment is a payment type from member account to debit account, no longer to community account
 * Now the amount shown in the loan search (and loan payments) is formatted using the currency pattern
 * Added a setting to show / hide the counters in advertisement categories, in ad search
 * Now a custom field possible value (for enumerated fields) can be enabled / disabled
 * Added the possibility to replace all occurrences of a given custom field possible value by another one
 * Now, members can both perform and receive payments in the <server url>/quickpayment access

Bug fixes
 * Fixed a problem when read from Linux a windows-saved customized file (the Windows' carriage-return character causes the file to be considered different)
 * When authorizing payments with transaction fees, the account statuses were not being updated for those fees, which led to incorrect balance and reserved amount being shown on accounts
 * It was not possible to have only the permission to discard loans without the permission to repay
 * When an user logged out, on the next login he would see the same page before logout, not the home page
 * The conciliation status was being shown to member on transaction details
 * When issuing guarantees which have loans which require authorization, fees were generated without the loan being totally accepted
 * When viewing the account history with permission to view authorized payments, the canceled status was missing in the filter
 * Fixed some wrong calculations with nested authorized fees, with multiple authorization levels
 * It was possible to cancel generated transactions while awaiting authorization, which makes no sense. Only main transactions may be canceled
 * When authorizing a payment with multiple authorization levels, the member was being notified that the payment was rejected when it was actually authorized to a next level. In this case, the member shouldn't be notified at all.
 * Accessing a page when the session has expired redirects the user to the login page. However, when entering and invalid password, after a successful login, the previous page was no longer displayed, but the home instead
 * The print transaction was not showing the currency in the amount field
 * When logging in as member and then changing the url to the cyclos/mobile interface, there was an error. Now the user is logged out
 * The view error log details page layout was broken due to large error details
 * The currency pattern was not being shown in the transaction details
 * When sending invoices from member to member through the menu, some unusual configuration could lead to not enabling a currency where it should be enabled
 * The print receipt for posweb was yielding a permission error when the connected operator didn't have the permission to view account history as well
 * Changing the order for custom fields in a member record type was returning to the wrong page
 * The summary in the print loans and print loan payments was not taking into account the currency (the summary is showed only if a transfer type is selected)
 * In the external payment processing, the date parameter was being ignored
 * An admin without transaction password (when it's enabled) viewing a transaction would see the actions to authorize / deny (when still pending authorization), but would never be able to auth / deby since he had no transaction password
 * Fixed some cases where a group couldn't be removed
 * Creating a new permission group based on another one now also copies the relationship to group filters
 * Stop customizing the last file in a group or group filter was resulting in application error
 * After clicking Modify and then Cancel in customize new file for group or group filter, the contents was being cleaned
 * Repeated field mappings for file imports in external account are no longer allowed
 * When adding a member to a loan group, and that member already belonged to the group, there was an application error
 * When a static file was customized for a group filter, customizing it globally could actually update the former, not the latter
